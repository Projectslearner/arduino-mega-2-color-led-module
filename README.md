# 2-Color LED Module

#### Project Overview

The 2-Color LED Module project demonstrates how to control a bi-color LED using an Arduino Mega. Bi-color LEDs, which contain two LEDs of different colors in a single package, are useful for indicating multiple states in various applications. This project will alternate between turning on the red and green LEDs with a defined delay, showing how to manage dual LEDs for status indication or simple visual effects.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Mega**
2. **2-Color LED Module (Red and Green)**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the 2-Color LED Module to Arduino Mega:**
   - Connect the red LED pin of the module to digital pin 9 on the Arduino Mega.
   - Connect the green LED pin of the module to digital pin 10 on the Arduino Mega.
   - Connect the common cathode or anode of the LED module to GND or VCC accordingly.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the 2-color LED module to the Arduino Mega as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, the LED should alternate between red and green colors with a one-second delay.
   - Open the serial monitor to see the status messages indicating which LED is currently on.

#### Applications

- **Status Indicators:** Use bi-color LEDs to indicate different states or modes in your project.
- **Visual Effects:** Create simple visual effects by alternating colors in sequence.
- **Alerts:** Use different colors to signal different types of alerts or notifications.

#### Notes

- Ensure the correct connection of the common terminal (cathode or anode) of the bi-color LED module based on its type.
- Adjust the delay time as needed to change the rate of color switching.
- Experiment with additional functions to create more complex lighting patterns or behaviors.
